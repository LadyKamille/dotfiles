# ai

Agent-agnostic instructions, skills, and per-agent settings. `install.sh` symlinks
everything into the paths each agent expects, so edits made during a session are
already staged in git.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Canonical global instructions. Linked to Claude's `CLAUDE.md`, Copilot's `copilot-instructions.md`, Gemini's `GEMINI.md`. |
| `skills/` | Portable `SKILL.md` skills, linked as the shared `~/.agents/skills` store that Claude Code and Copilot CLI both read. |
| `vendor/` | Submodules for skills authored elsewhere; `skills/` holds symlinks into them rather than copies. |
| `prompts/` | Reusable prompt snippets, referenced from skills or pasted by hand. |
| `adapters/claude/` | Claude Code settings and statusline. |
| `adapters/herdr/` | herdr's `config.toml`, plus the plugin set to reinstall by source. |

## Install

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # first clone only
DRY_RUN=1 ./install.sh                    # print what would change
./install.sh                              # link it
```

Anything already at a target path is moved into `~/.agent-config-backups/` first.
Rerunning is a no-op.

## Keeping work config out of a public repo

This repo is public, so `adapters/claude/settings.json` holds only public
marketplaces and plugins. Employer-specific marketplaces and plugins stay in
`~/.claude/settings.local.json`, which Claude Code merges over `settings.json`
and which this repo neither tracks nor generates. Keep credentials out of both;
use environment variables.

## What deliberately stays out

Machine state and transcript data under `~/.claude`: `history.jsonl`, `projects/`,
`sessions/`, `session-env/`, `file-history/`, `shell-snapshots/`, `__store.db`,
`cache/`, `backups/`, `plugins/`, `remote-settings*.json`, `policy-limits.json`.
Plugins are reinstalled from `enabledPlugins` rather than vendored.

Copilot CLI's `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` and Codex's `~/.codex/config.toml` are
also untracked: both are rewritten by their apps and hold absolute local paths.

## Adding a skill from someone else's repo or gist

```bash
git submodule add <clone-url> ai/vendor/<short-name>
mkdir -p ai/skills/<skill-name>
ln -s ../../vendor/<short-name>/<file>.md ai/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

The symlink is what git tracks, so the upstream content is never copied and the
submodule pins the commit you reviewed. `git submodule update --remote` pulls
newer upstream revisions when you want them.
